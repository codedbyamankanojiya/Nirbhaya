# Nirbhaya
A comprehensive Women's safety and real-time emergency assistance application, meticulously crafted as a proof-of-concept mobile-first web app. Built on a modern technology stack, it leverages the power of Next.js with its App Router for a high-performance, server-enhanced frontend, written entirely in TypeScript to ensure code robustness and maintainability. The user interface is constructed with the highly-acclaimed shadcn/ui component library, which utilizes Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling, and lucide-react for a clean and consistent iconography, all presented within a simulated smartphone shell to emphasize its mobile-first design. The application's architecture is component-driven, featuring a clear separation between application-specific logic and reusable UI elements, with state managed primarily through React hooks. Its core functionality is centered around user safety, offering a suite of powerful features: a prominent, animated SOS button for immediate alert broadcasting; a "Fake Call" feature to de-escalate unsafe situations; a "Community Safety Map" that provides AI-generated crime heatmaps and safe route suggestions; a "Guardian Live Tracking" system for sharing location with trusted contacts; and a rich library of "Safety Resources." The intelligence behind these features is powered by Google's Genkit, which orchestrates server-side AI flows using the Gemini model to provide services like the conversational "AI Safety Assistant," which offers real-time advice, and the data analysis required for the safety map, demonstrating a seamless integration of generative AI to create a proactive and responsive personal safety tool.
